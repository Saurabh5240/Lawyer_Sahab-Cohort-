## Implementation as a business model:
- RTC SERVER MONETIZATION
  
      - RTC will be charged slot wise based upon time and the price depends upon the lawyerâ€™s expertise and rating.
      - Eg : A lawyer charges Rs 150 for every 15 minutes 10% wil be added as business cost, so a client can have a consultant for 15 minutes in Rs 165. As a bonus concession will be provided on the overall cost 
      for slots which run for 30 minutes, 45 minutes , 60 minutes.  
      - Calculations:-     
          Cost for 15 minutes = Rs (150+15) 
          Cost for 30 minutes = Rs (300+30) -> Rs(290+20)
          Cost for 45 minutes = Rs (450+45) -> Rs(430+25)
          Cost for 60 minutes = Rs (600+60) -> Rs(570+35)
- DOCUMENT ANALYSER MONTIZATION
  
      - Minimum Rs 10 will be charged for document analysis if the no. of pages are less than 20 and 0.25 per page will be charged after that. 
      - cost for 100 pages document :- Rs 30 .
      - Any number of question will be asked.
